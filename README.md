# QuickTransmission
Fastest way to initialize transmission for Ubuntu

This script is very simple, first it installs transmission, then echo's the config file from the script to the location, it starts transmission and we're off.
Edit the script to your liking as you want, you are free to do anything with it.

Remember you MUST edit "rpc-whitelist": "1.2.3.4", to your external IP, or disable the whitelist and change the username/password and port.
